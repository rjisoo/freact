## Finding a cycle in a Linked List

Slides: http://slides.com/beelai88/reacto-3-2-3

Given a linked list, determine whether or not there is a cycle within the linked list (a cycle is when a node points to an earlier node in the Linked List, creating a loop). If there is a cycle, also find out the length of the cycle and the node at which the cycle starts. 

Caveat: you may not use any additional data structures, nor may you modify the existing data structure.
