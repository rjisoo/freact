######The Question
You have three rods sticking out of the ground. There are three disks of varying size that are stacked in the rod on the left. The goal is to move all three disks to the last rod on the right. The rule is that as you move disks between rods, you cannot stack a larger disk on a smaller disk. Write a function that will print the instructions to move the disks from a rod to another rod.
